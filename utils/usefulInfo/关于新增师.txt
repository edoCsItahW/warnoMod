Even if i can help you not much , at least i can give you a jumpstart.
I still have to try a lotmyself.

There are you files you want to look for

DeckSerializer/DivisionList is the list of units, packs and decks just add your Divisions in the same format, but use a new number.

e.g
(Descriptor_Deck_Division_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi, 207),

~/Descriptor_Deck_Division_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi,

Unfortunately i don't know what this list actually do, but my division appeared in arsenal as soon i wrote it here.

The file division is your actually division. At least for me is is almost self explanatory what means what.
e.g. (this is what they look like)
Descriptor_Deck_Division_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi is TDeckDivisionDescriptor
(
.
.
.


In the [] comes the Packs you want to add and the number of it. Look into the file pack for the pack names.

(~/Descriptor_Deck_Pack_TOE_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV, 2),
2 Packs of an art unit.

There are few interisting setting for you in divisions but i still dont know change them.
DivisionName = 'PFMPJNZAXB' is the actually name. Every division which would use it gets the name of the 27th. I asume somewhere is a file that translate the letters into a actually name. If you change it into something new the name of you division will be blank.

PortraitTexture = "Texture_Division_Portrait_default"
TypeTexture = "Texture_Division_Type_infantryReg"

This is something i cant get my head around because i asumed a path or somthing that i can just fill with my own png or something like that. Probably there is a file for this aswell.

Also it uses axis for pact.

In the file DivisionCostMatrix you can find you cost matrix

CostMatrix = MatrixCostName_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi (this is in the divsions file )

MatrixCostName_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi is MAP
[
(EDefaultFactories/AT, [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Defense, [0]),
(EDefaultFactories/Helis, [1, 1, 2, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Infantry, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Logistic, [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Planes, [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Recons, [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Support, [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
(EDefaultFactories/Tanks, [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]),
]

I think thats pretty much self explanatory


DivisionRules states which pack has how many units, which transports and how the experience is distributed.

~/Descriptor_Deck_Division_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_multi,
TDeckDivisionRule
(
UnitRuleList =
[
TDeckUniteRule
(
UnitDescriptor = $/GFX/Unit/Descriptor_Unit_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV
AvailableWithoutTransport = True
NumberOfUnitInPack = 3
NumberOfUnitInPackXPMultiplier = [1.0, 0.68, 0.49, 0.0]
),
. After that a new "Rule" is set for the next unit.
.
.

As you can see in in this file states you have in a pack 3 units (specific for this division)
and the Exp ratios. In this case you got 1 times 3 rookies, 0.68 times 3 trained and 0.49 time 3 experienced units

In the file packs you find your packs.

Descriptor_Deck_Pack_TOE_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_challenge_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV is TDeckPackDescriptor
(
DescriptorId = GUID:{aa198597-9ec7-4c85-8f5a-31652ad1e62a}
CfgName = 'TOE_SOV_27_Gds_Rifle_challenge_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV'
TransporterAndUnitsList =
[
TDeckTransporterAndUnitsDescriptor
(
UnitDescriptor = $/GFX/Unit/Descriptor_Unit_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV
),
]
)



\steamapps\common\WARNO\Mods\ModName\GameData\Generated\Gameplay\Gfx
Here the find UniteDescriptor which includes every unit in game, look here for the unitnames

They start like that followed by a bunch of settings
export Descriptor_Unit_2S1_Gvozdika_SOV is TEntityDescriptor
(

The main problem is that somewhere is a file that needs a specific object, but you dont know that because your actually edited file has no reference to that. The compiler also dont tell you that missing link a mistake. You only know something isnt working.

You can visit youtube, someone called oatmilk has uploaded a "tutorial".
Its not perfekt but should give you an idea how to mess around with the files.


If i make progress i will update you.

i hope i helped you somwhat.
